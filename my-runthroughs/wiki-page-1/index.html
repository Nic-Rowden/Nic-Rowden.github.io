         <b>Crown Shyness</b> (also
         <i>canopy disengagements,</i> <sup>[1]</sup> 
         <i>canopy shyness,</i><sup>[2]</sup> or 
         <i>inter-crown spacing</i><sup>[3]</sup>)
         is a feature observed in some tree species, in which the crowns of fully stocked trees do not touch each other, 
         instead forming a canopy with channel-like gaps.<sup>[4][5]</sup> 
         This is most prevalent among trees of the same species, but also occurs between trees of different species.<sup>[6][7]</sup>
         There exist many hypotheses as to why crown shyness is an adaptive behavior, and research suggests that it might inhibit spread of leaf-eating insect larvae.<sup>[8]</sup>

            The exact physiological basis of crown shyness is not 
            certain.<sup>[6]</sup> The phenomenon has been 
            discussed in scientific literature since 
            the 1920s.<sup>[9]</sup> The variety of hypotheses 
            and experimental results might suggest that there are 
            multiple mechanisms across different species, an 
            example of convergent evolution.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
